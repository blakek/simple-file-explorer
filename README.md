> A simple file explorer mainly for hosting videos and music files from a directory.

This project is a simple file explorer that allows you to host videos and music files from a directory.

I just made it for personal use so I could easily share some old videos with friends and family.

## Getting Started

[Bun] is required to run this project.

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Start the server using one of the predefined scripts. For example:

```sh
bun dev # Start the development server in the current directory
FS_ROOT=/path/to/directory bun dev # Start the development server in a specific directory
bun start # Start the production server in the current directory (also accepts FS_ROOT)
```
